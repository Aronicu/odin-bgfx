# BGFX Odin Bindings

Odin language bindings for [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx), a cross-platform rendering library.

**Note:** These bindings are currently in development and may be incomplete. Contributions are welcome!

Current limitations:
- Some functions may be incomplete
- Dynamic and debug libraries and all Mac libraries are not provided yet
- Constants still need to be converted to bitsets
- and probably more...

## Examples

The examples are organized from simplest to most complex to help you get started. All examples currently use GLFW as the windowing system.
